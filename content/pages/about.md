Hi! I'm currently working at Datadog.

My responsibilities include building a clean and user-friendly API, ensuring the access control layer is rigid and sound, and keeping the authorization/authorization layer secure and performant.

I have also worked at a variety of other companies ranging from a smaller eCommerce company to larger FinTech corporations, working through all parts of the stack and layers of the software development life cycle.

My inbox is always open so feel free to contact me. I'd love to hear about what you're currently working on!
