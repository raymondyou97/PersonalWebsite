Hi! I'm an incoming Software Engineer at Datadog where I will be working on the backend API web team.

My responsibilities will include building a clean and user-friendly API, ensuring the access control layer is rigid and sound, and keeping the authorization/authorization layer secure and performant.

I have also worked at a variety of other companies ranging from a smaller eCommerce company to larger FinTech corporations, working through all parts of the stack and layers of the software development life cycle.
