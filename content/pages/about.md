Hi! I'm currently working at Datadog.

I am part of the Web Reliability Team at Datadog. Our team manages the deployments and infrastructure of the web app for Datadog, the current and future for our API platform, internal tooling and frameworks to empower other engineering teams, and more.

I have also worked at a variety of other companies ranging from a smaller eCommerce company to larger FinTech corporations, working through all parts of the stack and layers of the software development life cycle.

My inbox is always open so feel free to contact me. I'd love to hear about what you're currently working on!
