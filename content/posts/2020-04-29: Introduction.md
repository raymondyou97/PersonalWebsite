Welcome to my personal website/blog! Starting up a blog has been something that I've always wanted to do and thanks to the COVID-19 crisis, I have all the time in the world at home now. 

Writing is something that I think is important for everyone to do and keep up with constantly and a CS undergraudate curriculum doesn't exactly have lots of plain old writing involved. 

This blog is mainly for myself to dump my current musings and to look back on in the future to see how I've grown. I will also spend minimal effort on grammar and proofreading so hopefully it is legible enough.

Some of the posts that you will probably see in the future are:

* Life updates
* CS/Tech that I am currently playing with
* Guides on literally anything
* Recommendations, reviews and tier-lists on literally anything
* Ramblings on literally anything

As you can see, I am really not sure what I am going to write about or how you ended up here but hopefully its interesting enough that you stay around and perhaps learn something new!

Also, I would like to thank the author of [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) which is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) theme that is excellent for starting up a personal blog and because I am not the best web designer...
