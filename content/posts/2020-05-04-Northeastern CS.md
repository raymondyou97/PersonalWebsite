Now that I have finally graduated from Northeastern with my B.S. and have had time to reflect, I just want to write out my thoughts on the program holistically. If you are someone considering going to Northeastern for CS, I recommend you read this.

To start, the program is essentially broken down into two parts. Your typical coursework/classes (the usual among all colleges) and then co-ops (unique to Northeastern).

## Coursework

The coursework has your typical, rigorous, and complete computer science education with a good balance of theoretical and coding courses.

In your theoretical courses you learn about stuff such as algorithms, Turing machines, logic proofs, etc. On the other side, you learn about programming, web development/software development, data structures, and more.

Not to say that these two categories are mutually exclusive, but these are the two school of thoughts that I like to use for categorization.

Once again, this is very bare and minimum list. You will learn a limitless number of things that will guide you through a lifetime.

## Co-op

Northeastern is different from your typical 4-year undergraduate programs as they incorporate co-ops also known as cooperative educations into the program. Co-ops are essentially longer internships that happen during the typical school year. These co-ops are typically 6 months long. You then make up the lost time from co-op by taking summer classes. Therefore, most NEU students graduate in 5 or 6 years.

The benefits of co-ops are that you learn new material in the classroom that you can bring back to the job and vice-versa. You come out of college with multiple, valuable work experiences in difference sectors.

Northeastern also helps you a ton with your job search as for most of us, this is our first time looking for a real job. They provide you with in-depth training, review sessions, and interview prep. But most importantly, they provide you that Northeastern network that they have already built with many companies that you can leverege for job opportunities.

## Thoughts

Overall, the best thing about Northeastern are the co-ops. Iâ€™m willing to bet that most former students would agree.

You learn important technical knowledge in your field. You earn a salary while also not having to worry about school tuition. You graduate with multiple work experiences on your resume. You grow in interpersonal and intrapersonal work experience that can only be gained on the job.

In terms of the courses and professors, they were generally fine. I'm sure any problems that students bring up about classes and professors aren't unique to Northeastern such as the professor being a horrible, or the class being impossible... I've had my fair share of professors that I love and professors that I didn't learn a single thing from.

## Final Words

Nonetheless, if you are currently deciding between Northeastern and MIT, why are you even here, go to MIT! But if Northeastern is one of your target schools and you are considering coming, you should come (with as little OR MUCH bias as possible). You will learn about the same amount of material that your peers in other universities are learning, but also come out with valuable work experience that puts you multitudes ahead.
