Now that I have just graduated from Northeastern with my B.S. in Computer Science, I just wanted to reflect over the past 5 years on the things I liked about the program and things I didn't like. If you are someone considering going to Northeastern for CS, I recommend you read this.

To start, the program is essentially broken down into two parts. Your typical coursework and then co-ops.

## Coursework

The coursework has your typical, rigorous, and complete computer science education with a good balance of theoretical and coding courses.

To give you a bare idea, in your theoretical courses you learn about algorithms, Turing machines, proofs, etc. On the other land, you learn about programming, web development/software development in your coding courses. 

Once again, this is very bare and minimum list. You will learn a limitless number of things that would take forever to list here.

## Co-op

Northeastern is different from your typical 4-year undergraduate programs as they incorporate co-ops also known as cooperative educations into the program. Co-ops are essentially longer internships, most commonly 6 months, that happen during the typical school year. You then make up the lost time from co-op by taking summer classes. Therefore, most NEU students graduate in 5 or 6 years.

The benefits of this are that you supposedly will learn new material in the classroom that you can bring to the job, and then you learn new material during the job that you can bring back to the classroom, and so on. You will also come out of college with multiple, valuable work experiences.

Northeastern also helps you a ton with your job search as for most of us, this is our first time looking for a real job and we are initially lost in the search. They provide you with training, review sessions, and interview prep.

## Thoughts

Overall, the best thing about Northeastern are the co-ops. I’m willing to bet that most NEU students would agree.

You learn so much important knowledge on the job that you can take away with you the rest of your life. You make a crap top of money while also not needing to pay for school tuition during that time. You graduate with multiple work experience on your resume that is invaluable to employers. You also grow not only in technical knowledge but interpersonal and intrapersonal work knowledge that can only be gained on the job. 

The courses were a hit or miss, though definitely more positive then negative. Your professor will pretty much determine how well the course is. There are courses that are taught by professors who are well past their prime in age and teaching ability and are just looking for that paycheck at the end of the day. Though, I’m sure this is common in all colleges.

There are also courses that feel misaligned and misplaced in the program. For example, Software Development is a course where you learn about the SDLC, Agile, Git, testing and more and you are only able to take this course after you go on your first co-op and by that point, you have already learned all that material on the job. Another example is Embedded Design: Enabling Robotics, where you learn about embedded systems and work with MATLAB, Simulink, and robotics.

These are just some small gripes I’ve had but nonetheless, the courses were overall beneficial, and I’ve learned a lot of valuable knowledge from amazing people that I will take away for the rest of my life.

## Final Words

If you are deciding between Northeastern and MIT for your computer science education, why are you even reading this, go to MIT. But if you are truly considering Northeastern CS, come to Northeastern. You will learn the same material that your peers in other universities are also learning, but you will also come out with work experience that puts you multitudes ahead of all your peers.
