I have been remotely for almost 8 months now due to the epidemic, and overall, I enjoy it a lot better than the office. Granted, I will have to do a more in-depth analysis once I can go back into the office and can compare side-by-side, but it has been quite pleasant not losing 2 hours of my life each day commuting.

Because of working from home now, I had to get an actual home office as before, I was just using random equipment and peripherals I found in the house and some beatdown chair that gave me pain after sitting down for too long.

Nonetheless, here is the list of everything in the pictures below and quick thoughts for each item.

**TLDR with costs (how much I paid) and links:**

- Desk: Uplift Standing Desk V2, 42" x 30" ($649)

This was my first venture into the standing desk world and I highly recommend getting one. From doing some research, Uplift was considered the top premium choice but you can probably find some cheaper options on Amazon or Autonomous. Previously, I would sit down the entire work day and that wasn't the greatest health wise. Now, I sit down for half the day, and stand for the rest of the day (usually after lunch).

- Chair: Steelcase Leap V2 ($300)

I highly, highly, highly recommend getting a high-quality, ergonomics chair. You are going to be sitting down for 8 hours everyday for most of your life and if your sitting down on some cheap chair with no cushioning nor support, your going to quickly develop long-term pain. These chairs easily run for 1000 or more, but you can get a used one that's in great shape and quality from Ebay, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace for around 250-400. Some other good options are the Herman Miller Aeron, Herman Miller Embody, Steelcase Gesture. These two brands are just very dependable and premium.

- Monitor 1: Dell UltraSharp 27 Inch Monitor - U2719D ($439.99)

Any 27 Inch IPS monitor will do. Definitely recommend IPS over TN monitors, as TN monitors have different colors depending on which angle you view it at. You also probably don't need a QHD or UHD monitor as they are significantly more pricey, unless your like a graphics designer or video editor. Any of the mainstream brands will do just fine (Dell, BenQ, HP, etc).

- Monitor 2: BenQ 27 Inch IPS Monitor GW2780 ($169.99)

Same comments as above.

- Monitor Desk Stand: VIVO Dual LCD Monitor Desk Mount Stand ($39.95)

A monitor desk stand saves so much space on your desk. Previously, my desk was super cramped and lacking in real estate as the default monitor stand takes up quite a lot of space. Would highly recommend.

- Webcam: Amcrest 1080P Webcam ($39.99)

This webcam is alright as it feels more like a low-end webcam. I had no choice as all the other webcams were sold out due to high demand because of Covid and this was the only one available. If I could, I would get the Logitech C920x webcam as I've had that in the past and the video was always super rich and high-quality.

- Laptop Dock: CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 Dock ($249.99)

I would also recommend getting any dock for your laptop, especially if your laptop doesn't have enough ports like mine, even more so if it is USB-C (your going to need a dongle/adapter for everything...).

This dock is a bit pricey but it is amazing. There is a port for literally everything you could possibly need on it and it is just a single cable connection back to the laptop. So if you constantly unplug and plug back, you only need to plug in one cable now.

- Mouse: Razer DeathAdder V2 ($69.99)

I know Razer has a bad rep in the gaming industry but I personally love this mouse as it fits my right hand mouse grip especially well. I have large hands and this mouse is large, so it fit just right. If you don't know what mouse to get, just get the Logitech G502. I use this mouse for my gaming setup and you can never go wrong with this mouse or Logitech in general. Just get a mouse that fits the type of grip you have, ex. palm vs claw vs fingertip grip.

- Keyboard: Ducky One 2 RGB TKL RGB LED Double Shot PBT Mechanical Keyboard ($125)

Ever since I switched to mechanical keyboards when I was 14, I can never go back. It feels a lot nicer and comfortable typing. Won't go too in-depth here, but I would recommend getting a Tenkeyless from a brand that uses mainstream switches such as Cherry, Topre, ALPS, Gateron. There are a bunch of super cheap mechnical keyboards on Amazon (< $50). Avoid those.

- Speakers: Micca MB42X Bookshelf Speakers ($89.99)

No comment here as I just like listening to music on nice speakers when I'm at home. In the office, I use ANC headphones (Bose QC 35 II), as I can't blast music in the office openly and the office chatter can be loud sometimes.

- Speaker Amp: Lepy LP-2020A Digital Amplifier ($26.99)

You'll need some amp if you get passive bookshelf speakers.

- Mouse Pad: Amazon Basics Gaming Mouse Pad ($7.49)

You should get an actual mouse pad. It hurts my eyes when I see people use a mouse without a mousepad, aka on the flat desk surface...

---

- Wrist Pad: Aelfox Keyboard Wrist Rest ($20.99)

Everyone should get some form of wrist rest as you want to make sure you have good keyboard/typing posture. You don't want to develop wrist pain down the line.

---

- Power Strip: Tripp Lite 6 Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip Clamp Mount ($30.99)

This is more optional as I am a neat freak and like to maintain clean cable management behind the scenes. With a power strip that I can mount on my standing desk, cables don't go flailing left and right as the desk rises up and down.

Total: $2260.35
