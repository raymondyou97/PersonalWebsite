                Hi! I'm an incoming Software Engineer at <a className="dg" href="https://datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a> where I will be working on the 
                backend API web team. My responsibilities will be building a clean and user-friendly API, 
                ensuring the access control layer is rigid and sound, and keeping the authorization/authorization layer 
                secure and performant.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also worked at a variety of other companies ranging from a smaller eCommerce company to larger FinTech corporations, working through all
                parts of the stack and the software development life cycle. Reach out through one of my socials!
